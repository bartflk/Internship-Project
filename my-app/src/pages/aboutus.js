                                We are a non profit with a goal to help you find an internship.

                                Internship Japan is a growing group of people working voluntarily (Non-Profit Organization)
                                for the mission to establish and support a new and better system of internships in Japan.
                                We at Internship Japan believe that young and highly-motivated foreigners willing to work
                                and study in Japan can be a great asset to Japan's business world. The Japanese language is
                                one of the key points for us, so we believe in a joint combination of internships and language
                                education. Most importantly, we strongly believe that interns should not incur any costs for
                                finding an internship program.

                                        One of the activities of Internship Japan is to support a network of opportunities for every
                                        party involved. These parties include: interns, companies and educators. To connect those
                                        parties an online system has to be made. The system will be a database with the information
                                        of prospect interns, schools and internship providers. All of those parties should be able to
                                        register a profile which will be shown on the platform. A user can search on the platform to a
                                        specific company, intern or educational system.
